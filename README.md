# Lab-2-Codefellows-201

1st Submission: This Lab is a small project meant to demonstrate a very basic understanding of HTML and CSS and an understanding of Javascript conditionals.

We were supposed to use conditionals to validate a user's response to questions we asked them and to respond to the user's responses with different responses depending on how they responded.

2nd Submission: After inital submission of this lab we were asked to do more, demonstrating knowledge of more HTML and CSS and an understanding of Javascripts Loops and Arrays.
