      <h1>Ten Places I want to visit but have not yet:</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Mars, because well... its Mars.</li>
        <li>India, because I like the food and it is one of the five places human civilization originally sprung up.</li>
        <li>Japan, becase I almost became an archaelogist and Japan is one of the only locations in the world where human societies were well into the Bronze Age before adopting Agriculture</li>
        <li>China, for almost exactly the same reasons as India.</li>
        <li>South Korea, because I want to see what a country with good Internet looks like.</li>
        <li>South Africa, because I want to visit an archaelogical dig site that is incredibly important to the history of our species.</li>
        <li>Istanbul, because I want to see what the second Rome looks like.</li>
        <li>Russia, although this one not anytime soon. My Mom was born here, so I would like to see her home country.</li>
        <li>Earth Orbit, because I want to see what our planet looks like from up high.</li>
        <li>Another Star System, because I want to see what the Sun looks like from several light years away.</li>
     </ol>
